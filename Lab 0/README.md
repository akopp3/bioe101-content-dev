## TODO ##

Add section on common ground and other different types of ground (Earth ground, Common Ground, DC Ground, AC Ground, Virtual Ground)

Different types of coupling (AC vs DC coupling)

Add section on different types of cables, put labels on rack + take picture
In microcontroller section
 - add picture of Arduino
 - not a exhaustive list, mention FPGAs, CPLDs, other DAQs
 
Make the prelab a little harder - review of BioE 105 materials? Diagnostic Test based off of 105 circuits

Situational prelab questions - asking what is wrong with a picture (wrong cable used, unsafe lab procedure)

For prelab questions, prime them for actual lab so they know what to do when they go through lab
